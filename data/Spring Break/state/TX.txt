Today is the last day of spring break. So you can A. Spend the day getting homework done and be ready for school on Monday, or B. Procrastinate and not get any work done. We suggest B because it’s the most likely to happen out of the two.
I wished the school year would go by as fast as spring break did 🤦🏼‍♀️

I deep clean my restroom every Saturday morning, and I maintain it through the week. 

Ask my sons what they did this Spring Break, and they'll respond:

"We learned how to properly clean a toilet."

I told them girls like boys who are clean, and to stay away from a dirty girl.🤣

this has been literally the worst spring break of my entire life.

what was supposed to be a fun and educational college experience was actually a nightmare of unappreciated hard work and some insecure dude using his power to make people feel bad about themselves.
spring break 2018 was a good one and can’t wait for more :)
Next year I’m taking my spring break talents to the money 💰...... I will be sitting that trip out to run it up.

I’ll be honest, partying the next few days sounds like a stellar way to spend Spring Break. Honestly, I’d rather spend the day pointlessly driving around with someone, eating, and watching movies till we fall asleep. I doubt that’s how tomorrow will go.

Y’all done spring break hoeing yet?

One week for spring break isn’t enough. It needs to be 2 weeks. 
1 week to be a chiflada and lazy
1 week to recover and prep for school

This spring break has been so relaxing I forgot I had a job lmao
Okay like but I’m still sad that for spring break I only wanted to see a specific person but they were too busy to hang out. I get that I’m not the center of the universe and he has shit to do but I’m still pretty bummed out that I have to wait til May now https://t.co/vLEZ6RELww

Since I cannot remember what I wore to work the week before spring break I’m hoping no one else does either.
10 days and 112 hours of work later. My spring “break” is over. My feet hurt and all I want is a hot bath and a face mask. 🛁🛁🛁

Spring break really is a tease
Got sent home from work super early today by my boss to cut into my overtime hours. Not very pleased about it, because today was going a lot smoother than any other spring break day I worked and it felt like it might as well have been pay for standing around.
Spring break was a little crazy but that’s ok. 💁🏽‍♀️🥃🍻❤️ #BadDecisions https://t.co/2E98Ox6TgK
Hello Twitter, I would like to leave in writing that I caved over Spring Break and smoked cigarettes. I would also like to say that I’m not back on my bullshit, so it all ends today
