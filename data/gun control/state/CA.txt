Not yet sure how many ppl this affected, but FBI suggesting that failed background checks declined by 80% after the change. So while Dems,leftist,students,libs call for gun control-(abolish 2A) it was OBAMA who made it easier for criminals 2 buy &amp; continue 2 buy guns!

The 2nd amendment protects your right to own a gun, not ammunition. So, @WarrenBuffett @BillGates @JeffBezos please purchase every ammunition manufacturer and pull a @martinshkreli on bullets. See @chrisrock "Bullet Control." #MarchForOurLives #ammunitionreform #bulletcontrol
Mass shootings are horrific. But the issue of gun violence is so much bigger than that. My perspective on gun control was shaped by this community and their voices need to be heard. https://t.co/aoij7xsh8u

üá∫üá∏ is the largest arms maker &amp; dealer around the world. Our Corps &amp; Govt have us believing these are separate issues, they‚Äôre not. We‚Äôve got to think bigger... like disarming our Feds, Military &amp; Police FIRST.
I've long been aware of Jesse Hughes' right-wing views and left it at "agree to disagree" but this is where me and EODM part ways. Fight gun control all you want, Jesse, but don't level personal attacks against children who survived a mass shooting. https://t.co/V6iv9BmnYz

I've never feared a law abiding American with a gun. I've feared criminals with them. Stealing law abiding Americans's guns using the ruse of reducing crime is akin to taking cars to prevent drunk driving. No gun control law has ever caused criminals to surrender their guns.

Rick Santorum suggested students learn CPR *instead* of advocating for gun control? Learning CPR is always great, but how long does he think it takes? It's a one-day class to get certified, like 6 hours max.
I think that  is way better than more Gun control laws. Less legislation more solution. https://t.co/4pk3dRKB3Z
Hitler wanted gun control, Liberals want gun control. Hitler imposed censorship. Liberals want censorship imposed. Liberals aren't fighting Nazis, they are the Nazis. No wonder they are so angry.
Is it me, or are people protesting with the wrong items on their protest agenda? Gun control won't solve "crazy", and this problem isn't resolved with an elimination of the 2nd Amendment,  but with law enforcement not ignoring the obvious, and with ppl and politcians paying attn.
"The hypocrisy of the march employing armed guards at the anti-gun march" says a person who has absolutely no idea what gun control actually is.
I love that the crazy, gun loving right wingers are screaming that teenagers are not mature enough to talk about gun control, at the same time that they are screaming that you can't raise the age limit to buy guns to 21, because teenagers are totally mature enough to own guns.

69% of Americans are in favor of gun control. The number will grow. As a high school student said before being suspended from school, to Congress: "When will you get off your fucking dead asses, and do something!". I concur. https://t.co/qN5W1gfN0o
We need gun control because students should not have to worry about a school shooter while taking finals.
I already responded but I have another thought! üôÑ There have always been single-issue 2nd A voters. Now there may be single-issue gun control voters in the hundreds of thousands where there were none before now. What do you think? https://t.co/WMKx2IJWkT
March for Our Lives Gun Control March Long Beach https://t.co/Z7PaRZVAiI via @gruniongazette
If you think the march today was to  ‚Äúban‚Äù guns, you weren‚Äôt listening, (again)‚Äîshocker. It was to enact sensible gun control, which protects 2nd amendment but provides reasonable controls to limit, (but sadly, not end), events like Parkland. https://t.co/1O4z7EaV3F

So uhhh. What happens when an illegally acquired gun is used to shoot up another school? Where did that ‚Äúgun control‚Äù get you? Guns don‚Äôt kill people. People kill people. The root of this is issue is that we‚Äôre raising a bunch of pussies.

Want gun control? Impeach. Trump.
Listening to the NRA about gun control is like listening to Ronald McDonald about childhood obesity.
New AP poll: 90% of Democrats, 54% of gun owners and 50% of Republicans now favor stricter gun control laws. Will it motive voters? Republicans need to be defeated in Nov. And the Blue Dog/DCCC Democrats who are allied with the NRA need to be beaten in primaries

I wonder how many of these gun control activist, tag alongs and limelight seekers are going to pay money to watch a movie this weekend featuring their hero actors shooting it up, selling drugs, glorifying gangs and sexing it up...?
The fact there were no major gun control marches during the Obama administration when over 17,500 people were shot in Chicago and 4,000 killed makes me think today's #March4OurLives has very little to do with gun control.
The stupidity involved with not being able to differentiate between ‚Äúwe need better gun control‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want the government to ban guns entirely‚Äù explains why Trump was elected.
Gun Control is a touchy issue to talk about, but only cowards shy away from tough discussions.

It is sad to see gun control advocates, celebrities and people of wealth use a horrific event and the innocent faces of our children to further a political agenda regarding gun control.  To plan, finance and use them as an activist to support their cause, is concerning and wrong.
The @NRA is an organization filled with vile, selfish monsters. That they are even a part of the conversation on gun control is a joke. The marches today are a beautiful, glowing testament to the fact that these awful people support a dying cause. Their days are numbered. https://t.co/HP9GmmxMSP

Gun Control includes the Police. All these Liberal shits don't care that the police are killing people of colour. I'm anti gun control because we need guns to kill both the liberals and the police. We need guns for the revolution my comrades.
We should all be ‚Äúanti-homeless‚Äù being homeless is a terrible thing. Instead of funding giant marchs against gun control, why don‚Äôt we help the homeless ?
We cannot and will never repeal the Second Amendment. The only Amendment that was ever repealed was the 18th which prohibited alcohol. Amendments serve to expand our rights‚Äînot limit them. We can have commonsense gun control while still defending our Constitution.
Gun control also includes POC who've been murdered by cops!! This is insane. #BLM https://t.co/ekTuZ4varx

Unpopular opinion: It is possible to be both pro-gun and pro-gun control. As a gun owner with a clean background &amp; sound mind, why would I be against legislation that has no effect on me whatsoever but has the potential to keep guns out of the hands of those who pose a threat?
How many times does it have to be said??? These amazing kids are fighting for gun CONTROL! The only people who are saying gun ban are uninformed nut jobs
I have listened to @adamcarolla since I was 15 years old starting with Loveline on KROQ, the morning show, and onto the podcast. I was able to over look the breaking up of episodes so they could play more ads and the clean shows, but the hypocrisy of his views on gun control...
Even in places with rational gun control it takes an ongoing effort to reduce the number of unlicensed guns and ensure every gun owner is safe and qualified. Thank you #OPP https://t.co/PX4QqNnnwD
I disagree. Note the 2nd Amendment includes "regulated" which implies regulation of guns IS allowed. ü§î Why haven't gun control advocates seased on that? https://t.co/WrRGHUc3zU
We don't want to repeal the Second Amendment. Stop being ridiculous. Doing that is both impossible and unnecessary. It was already decided in Heller that gun control is constitutional.
all i want for 2018 is a massive turnout at the voting booth.  If People want change VOTE.  Pick a stance and vote it. Be it Gun Control or Choice. Pick a topic and hold M'Fer's accountable.  If not we go back to the future.

Gun control does not mean taking away guns completely. Why are people so fucking stupid?????
Y‚Äôall are supporting gun control being pushed by politicians who have armed guards. Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt see that shit or what?
Those calling for gun control are notorious liars, inflating the number of yearly mass shootings (from 4 to 355, in one case).

Liberals don‚Äôt care about the truth, they will lie if it serves their agenda.

Donald Trump decided to run off to Mar-a-Lago. This is unacceptable. He believes that teachers should carry guns and when students protest for gun control he runs off. I wonder if the NRA ran off also or maybe they are counter protesting.
I know quite a lot of people who own guns. None of them think about murdering people. However, I do think this march is good but in a state with already strict gun control? It doesn't make sense.

The reason Donald Trump is not doing a damn thing about gun control is because look at the dumbasses that got him into presidency. Step down as President Mr. Trump. You are not fit for being our president. You are not hearing the voices of the people.
It's not an issue of gun control. It's an issue of a lack of virtue in society. If you want to change that, getting rid of God in society will (and does) pose a problem. The more virtuous a society becomes, the less violent it becomes.

This is true, but:

We already have tough firearm restrictions in California and I don't think we need to go any further. California is not safe with "common sense gun control" and America would be hurt if we followed my states lead.
And let's be honest....#NeverAgain is a ridiculous slogan.  You could slap major gun control restrictions on the people and there will still be shootings at schools and public places.  Let's at least be logical.  We give these shootings so much attention! That's what kids want.

For the Republicans who don't want any gun control and say, "why blame it on the gun, blame it on the individual" we should be asking them why there are any laws about drug usage. Should let the individual decide.
The gun control kids mean well, but there's nothing revolutionary about their movement-- they're pro-cops, pro-military, pro-Bipartisanship, etc., essentially just advocates of the current liberal order, and that's why they muster such broad support; they change nothing

Gun control sounds like a great idea until you reflect on who you're trusting to do the controlling. The #police and the #military do more harm with guns than school kids and the mentally ill combined. Gun control amounts in practice to empowering the most violent people of all.

When Liberal/Progressive explain, without dodging the Question, How are they going to keep guns out of the hands of criminals?  Then we can talk about that kind of gun control.
Putting more guns into our schools is not the answer and it's ridiculous that GOP candidate for Governor Travis Allen still thinks this 'solution' to school shootings is little more than a ploy by the NRA.

Marching for gun control legislation is something.

I have a practical gun control suggestion that does not require Congress: schools should create and circulate lists of which homes have guns. I never knowingly let my kids go to a home with a gun. Lots of people feel the same.  It's social pressure, stigma. #MarchForOurLives
Most people who have such a hard on for gun control have actually no idea about half of the current laws for guns or even how guns work.

It‚Äôs actually really annoying. Although I believe certain things could be changed, banning guns makes absolutely no sense at all.

AB2382 by @AsmMikeGipson now expands the definition of "firearm" to include receiver blanks.

Thanks for using gun ‚Äúsafety‚Äù - so much more linked to the desired outcome rather than gun ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. I think using ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù allows some to demonize the discussion so that they  can be absolutist in their defense of 2A. https://t.co/mkaBnOKPhx

I imagine that the NRA gave Trump more money at that meeting - not just a reminder. Trump wanted ANOTHER bribe. That is why he pretended to be for gun control for a few days. That was Trump's sneaky message to the NRA; pay me more money or else. The NRA gave Trump another bribe. https://t.co/MVpGIgd7y4

A news update from staff reporter/ photographer, Nita Gardipee.
No student should have to live in fear that one day at school may be their last. We need gun control now.

The NRA boasts about its number of members, according to them, 5  to 8 million. The US census and Gallup polls tell us there are roughly 80 million gun owners in America. The NRA can't speak for all of them. Why does the NRA control 100% of gun policy? #MarchForOurLives
I strongly support guns for hunting, recreation &amp; the use of ARs in a gun range. But at minimum, DC must fund the teams &amp; tech to enforce background check laws. Dylann Roof &amp; Nikolas Cruz shouldn't have been able to buy guns under existing laws.  https://t.co/LtO3moRGru

i think the involvement of politicians is a result of the progress made by students, not an obstacle to further progress ‚Äî high schoolers can‚Äôt pass gun control on their own, and i think it‚Äôs unfair to reject institutional support when that‚Äôs what the end goal has always been https://t.co/HO0g3UqK7i

GUN CONTROL NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW. The fact that there are now all these kids getting inspired by the parkland shooting and joking to either shoot up a school or are legit going to do it is insane. Kids everywhere are feeling unsafe and the country is doing nothing.
Unpopular opinion: gun control would be about as effective as drug control....
