So many people are jumping on the gun control bandwagon. That‚Äôs good but no good will come out of a gun grab. It will lead to war and many people will die. You must choose a side.

Don't be fooled into thinking those on the left "just want justice." They don't just want "common sense gun measures." They want the little bit you're willing to offer in gun control measures, and then the rest as well, including taking ALL guns. They'd shank you in a moment.
The "gun control" movement isn't 100% bad. I'm sure there are a few merely misguided people who think they're calling for something that makes sense, but they're wrong. 99.99% of the gun control movement is aimed at taking your freedom away, which is evil, don't trivialize that.
We can't seem to agree on what "sensible gun control is" but I like your moxie, kid.  Spend the money you'll waste on chasing the gun control ghost and spend it on school security personnel + tech.  The money IS there.  #atleastyoutried #MarchForOurLives

The "gun control" movement isn't 100% bad. I'm sure there are a few merely misguided people who think they're calling for something that makes sense, but they're wrong. 99.99% of the gun control movement is aimed at taking your freedom away, which is evil, don't trivialize that.
Don't be fooled into thinking those on the left "just want justice." They don't just want "common sense gun measures." They want the little bit you're willing to offer in gun control measures, and then the rest as well, including taking ALL guns. They'd shank you in a moment.

Gun control does not mean to Repeal the Second Amendment.

Making sure you don‚Äôt say ‚Äúbomb‚Äù or ‚Äúthis place will explode‚Äù inside an airport or airplane is in fact, not banning the First Amendment.

Just like any other laws, our Constitution must be regulated to ensure safety.

970 WFLA Rush: Calypso Louie Counts the Crowd at Gun-Control March https://t.co/HSVzV7hpgM @RushLimbaugh
This whole gun control/2A argument is getting annoying now. Instead of steadily attacking each other, maybe the two sides should get together and work toward a compromise that doesn‚Äôt infringe on 2A but at the same time has gun control. Neither side is absolute in this.
Because that would muddy their gun control agenda. If the kids that are the "faces" of this movement were openly found to be the bully's who drove this young man to this brink, what do you think it would do to their little movement? https://t.co/LXFTCXDqXI

Tune into my show tonight at 8 on newsradio 102.5FM. We'll discuss the police shooting of Stephon Clark, why the #MarchForOurLives rally did gun control advocates no favors, and why the #GOP omnibus bill will destroy their credibility.
Appears that the Republicans are really pissed off that the kids are trying to do something to fix gun control.If these kids continue they will vote out politicians who do nothing but attend meetings. Kids should be in class trying to learn but you politicians didn‚Äôt do your job.
LBR. Gun control didn't become a problem until white kids started dying.
It's good that Black Americans are against liberal gun control, however part of the Omnibus bill gave authorities the right to take guns from Americans without due process. Democrats did stick it to Americans. While our focus was on the wall, their focus was on taking our guns. https://t.co/QSGgcsy9jK

it‚Äôs funny how republicans think our teachers are ‚Äúindoctrinating‚Äù us to want gun control. from what i‚Äôve seen, we‚Äôre indoctrinating them. we are the future.
The laws currently in place is not the issue. It's the politicians who are telling the police not to enforce the law that's the problem.  No amount of laws will control gun crime, if you restrict the police from enforcing the law.  Gun control is a scam to take away our rights. https://t.co/rGZNxY2K6L

If I was president I'd pass whatever gun control law you want as long as it was passed with tougher laws to cut down on distracted drivers.
You know I've figured out that most people arguing for stricter gun control don't know the difference between automatic and semi automatic guns, and also have never owned a gun and had to go through the process of getting an extensive background check to own a gun legally

Kind of thing that has nothing to do with gun control. It's a difference in education of the people. In general. https://t.co/VS9ULgiv3h
The weird thing about gun control is how much politicians (and the NRA) supported it when the idea was to suppress the Black Panther Party and Civil Rights movement. #MarchForOurLives #BlackLivesMatter #MulfordAct https://t.co/ClrX21S7J9
Yo @marcorubio Your constituents marched for gun control today. You were nowhere to be seen. Were you at a @NRA fund raiser instead?
Gun control is good, giving more power to police (who already have free reign to use their guns whenever) is bad. Cops are not mental health professionals.

Article from 2013 https://t.co/IgeTTe41Y6
We‚Äôve been sold ANOTHER BILL of FALSEHOODS!  This new spending bill GIVES EVERYTHING the DEMS/GOP-RINOs wanted at the expense of WE the TAX PAYING PEOPLE.  No $ for a Wall.  Gun Control measures eroding at the 2nd‚Äôs door.  Screw USA is what the Bill does.
Is there any other constitutional right that people fight to limit so feverishly with so little knowledge about what they are talking about than the 2nd? Oppose or support gun control all you want...but do your homework before you open your mouth.

Gun control is a theory, no guns equates to no more mass killings or even gun crime. 300 million guns in the hands of Americans is a fact that equates to the protection of freedom and liberty from government tyranny.
Told you they were nuts!

By the way over 30 million live in California and this is all the turnout?

This whole gun control/2A argument is getting annoying now. Instead of steadily attacking each other, maybe the two sides should get together and work toward a compromise that doesn‚Äôt infringe on 2A but at the same time has gun control. Neither side is absolute in this.

It's good that Black Americans are against liberal gun control, however part of the Omnibus bill gave authorities the right to take guns from Americans without due process. Democrats did stick it to Americans. While our focus was on the wall, their focus was on taking our guns. https://t.co/QSGgcsy9jK

What Marco (and others) fail to recognize is there are far more constituents in favor of gun control than those who oppose it. Democracy by its very nature favors the majority.

I hope every republican watching/attending #marchforourlives feels small, ashamed and outnumbered. I‚Äôm not even American but I am so proud of everyone standing up there today to prove that American needs gun control and they need it now!
I have to wonder how many marching today in #MarchforLife also support aborting and killing babies?  The hypocrisy astounds me.  Harden our schools? Absolutely!  Gun control: NOT a solution!

I asked someone recently why France wasn't included in his list of countries with strict gun control and no mass shootings. He attempted to change the subject.

Why are we just talking about gun control while our schools go largely unprotected ? We should put metal detectors, just like the airports and court houses use today, in every school nationwide with an armed resource officer running it during all hours the schools are open. .

Hey, I hope everyone is marching tomorrow for sound gun control. I married into a family of hunters; they hunt bow &amp; arrow &amp; rifles for sportsmanship. My father in law would not let my son go fishing with him w/out a license &amp; then hunting without taking a gun safety glass.
