Gun Control NOW!!!!! @dmx_biographer
In Texas, gun control means using BOTH hands
Kids crying about gun control obviously haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to know what actual gun control is. Gun control is not taking guns. It‚Äôs knowing which way to point one, the safety stays on until it‚Äôs time to shoot,and most importantly treat a gun as if it‚Äôs always loaded!

GUN CONTROL DOES NOT MEAN THE CEASE OF ALL GUNS. IT DOES NOT MEAN ANYONE WANTS TO TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY. WE WANT MENTAL HEALTH CHECKS. WE WANT IT TO BE HARDER FOR CRAZY ASSHOLES TO BUY GUNS. WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. WE WANT PROTECTION FOR OUR PEOPLE. #ENOUGH

Guns in the hands of honest citizens save lives and property and, yes, gun-control laws adversely affect only the law-abiding citizens. 
  Take note my fellow Americans, before it's too late.
  These kids are talking in favor of gun control, remind them of this history lesson.
Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century because of gun control: 56 million. 

  You won't see this data on the US evening news, or hear politicians disseminating this information.
Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to  1977, one million educated people, unable to defend themselves, were  rounded up and exterminated.
gun control is the wrong way to go.  we should work to solve this heinous crimes by aggressively search for better integration of intelligence between agencies  who need mental assistance and they be listed on the watch list  and insure that person is not able to purchase
Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979,  300,000 Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and  exterminated.
Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to  1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded  up and exterminated.
China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952,  20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves were  rounded up and exterminated.
Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to  1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were unable to defend  themselves were rounded up and exterminated. They used children to get the guns. https://t.co/dvQOiLnUab
so proud of my countryüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å≥Û†Å£Û†Å¥Û†Åø, standing with America today, take a stand against gun control, don‚Äôt lose faith, your change is coming‚ù§Ô∏è #MarchForOurLives
In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to  1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded  up and exterminated.
In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control.

 From 1929 to 1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.

2nd amendment says right shall not be infringed. Infringed means ‚Äúlimit or undermine‚Äù. Any gun control limits undermine our right to own arms so yes; these marchers are advocating the violation of the 2nd amendment. And if you allow SOME limits are okay, where does it stop?

Gun control works. Just ask the Russians under Stalin, Chinese under Mao, Cambodians under Pol Pot, Jews, Armenians...
Gun control laws only effect the people who will never feel the need to use a weapon. Outlaws don't care about laws. Anyone can get a weapon n use it against a society who is un armed. I own 6 weapons. Never went to a gun store to buy even one. 
2A guarantees 1A. Dont be a Victim

Student activists will be working "to build support for candidates with whom they are aligned" on gun control issues. One organization, HeadCount, has "roughly 5,000 volunteers" attending marches around the U.S. to register people to vote. https://t.co/LxYUbPwX6H
And that creates a badly warped view of the gun debate, where commonsense solutions to gun violence are ignored while the public attempts to make sense of the NRA‚Äôs distractions. https://t.co/f5fLfjctCK

Some gun companies donate a portion of every gun purchase directly to the NRA. The NRA has a ‚ÄúGolden Ring of Freedom‚Äù program that acknowledges groups that donate more than $1 million to the organization.  https://t.co/f5fLfjctCK
The NRA is a powerful industry lobbying group, often working on behalf of gun manufacturers. The group gets millions of dollars in direct donations from gun companies every year, and millions more in ad space that gun companies buy in NRA publications.  https://t.co/f5fLfjctCK

They include Fred Guttenberg, whose 14-year-old daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting; Rep.  Carlos Curbelo and Brian Mast, who authored an op-ed supporting a ban on assault weapons; and Dennis Blair, former DNI. In addition to Hoffman,  https://t.co/7VCbDkx8vE

I love America. Ultra conservatives will never give up their profit-making corporations building guns they have their lackey's eating up the propaganda and downright lies about gun control.
The Republicans aren't going to do anything on gun control on the federal level.

No one needs to use an assault weapon to protect themselves while walking home at night. No one should be allowed to use an AR-15 to strategically hunt people, which, in case anyone forgot, is what made us speak out in the first place. https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6
It would also benefit us to redefine what assault weapons are so that when we call for a ban against them, it‚Äôs clear that we aren‚Äôt trying to ban all guns.  https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6

Fed up with the apathy pervading this country, we realized that we don‚Äôt need to wait around to have our voices heard or for someone else to make change ‚Äî we have to be the change we need to see. https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6
After all of this pain and all of this death caused by gun violence, it seems as if the kids are the only ones who still have the energy to make change. https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6

The problem of gun violence goes beyond the countless demographic differences between people. Any way you cut it, one of the biggest threats to life as a teen in the U.S. today is being shot. https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6
Gun violence has torn up communities across the country, due to negligence of government to regulate access to guns, ignorance to their constituents‚Äô varying situations, and willingness to take money from organizations that do not have the best intentions. https://t.co/6kc0BIV4f6

Deaths via an AR-15 are SMALL MINISCULE percentage of gun deaths so why not focus on the real problems?

In recent weeks, both Bank of America and the asset manager BlackRock said they had reached out to firearms manufacturers and distributors to ask about responses to and strategies to stop mass shootings.  https://t.co/22bKjJu1q7

Not to mention, the NRA and people who do not want stricter gun control always scream about how we should not politicize a shooting of any kind yet they're doing just that by falsely targeting MSM and for using the SRO as evidence that more guns are beneficial.
The sad thing about the gun control debate is that most of the rabid gun nuts have been abused and ignored by the government too. Republicans have positioned their values so they can keep making things worse, but say "You could totally overthrow us if you need to." as a placebo.

The left harps about how gun control doesn‚Äôt mean taking away all guns but yet when pictures of the rallies come in all we see is how ‚Äúthe 2nd amendment is outdated‚Äù and when someone bans AR-15s it‚Äôs a ‚Äústep in the right direction.‚Äù What direction exactly? Complete gun ban?
I have found that when you use facts when talking about gun control with a NRA stooge, they are usually left speechless.
I like how everyone is still fighting for gun control and stuff like that, but there has been a lot of bombings in Austin and no one is fighting for bomb control... oh wait... could it be that people will get their hands on lethal weapons no matter if it‚Äôs legal or not? ü§î
The fact that a school resource officer, a COP, was able to stop a shooter is not an argument FOR arming teachers or AGAINST gun control.

Maryland school shooter was not, repeat NOT, stopped with a 'gun free zone' sign, a bunch of kids skipping class to protest, attacking the NRA or more gun control.  Stopped by an armed good guy (school resource officer) that returned fire and killed the shooter.

WAGV helped craft a mandate that requires handgun owners to safely lock up their weapons or face misdemeanor charges; the ordinance was first enacted in the city of Los Angeles before it recently became a proposed state law. https://t.co/BxojthZBSi
‚ÄúWe felt that if the public had to really deal with what it was like to be a survivor, that they would change their view of guns and gun violence,‚Äù Lane said. ‚ÄúIt also gave the survivors an opportunity to turn their grief into action.‚Äù  https://t.co/BxojthZBSi
One of the organization‚Äôs first big successes was pushing for better safety standards for handguns; they were particularly concerned about so-called ‚Äújunk guns,‚Äù which were small, cheaply made and easy to conceal.  https://t.co/BxojthZBSi
‚ÄúWe thought the best way to approach gun violence and gun issues was to start locally,‚Äù Lane told VICE Impact, ‚Äúbecause in California it was very hard to get anything passed statewide [back then]. We had a lot of friends on the Los Angeles City Council.‚Äù https://t.co/BxojthZBSi
According to the Violence Policy Center, for example, 93 percent of women killed by men in 2015 were murdered by someone they knew, and the most common weapon was a gun. https://t.co/BxojthZBSi

If denied an opportunity to meet with Toomey to seek to persuade him to cosponsor S.B. 2095, many of us will stage a sit-in until we are heard.

At Demand the Ban, we will publicly melt down an assault rifle, turning an instrument of death into one of life, a hand-plow garden implement. Hundreds will march through the streets of Philadelphia en route to a rally at Toomey‚Äôs office. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
You can say no to Pat Toomey and his colleagues, too, by joining my organization and other gun-control advocates at Demand the Ban in Philadelphia. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
Must we tolerate the death, destruction, grief, and everlasting trauma just so some may have fun with their assault guns, gun makers and sellers can enjoy the fruit of that carnage, and politicians can continue to benefit from the monetary support? https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
And, obviously, this issue is so much larger than hunting for sport. By not supporting the assault weapons ban, Toomey and his colleagues ignore the toll on human life. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
To those of Toomey‚Äôs ilk who tout that semi-automatic assault guns are ‚Äúsporting guns,‚Äù important for hunting and target shooting, I say, in Mike‚Äôs memory: Hogwash! What sport is there in using a 30- or even 50-bullet magazine to hunt an animal? https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
One of these kowtowing politicians is Pennsylvania‚Äôs own U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, who has declined to support, much less cosponsor, U.S. Senate Bill 2095, a new federal assault weapons ban. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
Why? Because cowardly politicians worry more about losing favor with the gun lobby and its patrons and funders in the gun industry than about the lives lost to these powerful and dangerous weapons. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
How could such a horrific thing happen? Because our country, alone among all developed countries, allows civilians to acquire semi-automatic assault guns. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
One man intent on mayhem had sufficient firepower to overwhelm a room full of trained and armed law officers. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G
Mike was the first to die, with a shot to the head. The others were shot and killed in a barrage from the gun‚Äôs 30-bullet ammunition magazine. Soon afterward, the shooter finished off the carnage by committing suicide. https://t.co/uzCzfdc73G

At the same time, they work to exploit any opportunity to sell guns whether it's passage of a gun control law, whether it's the election of Barack Obama - his re-election, whether it's 9/11. https://t.co/PLgBHNpLmr

Someone told me yesterday gun control just won‚Äôt work; I gave the only reply I could - yes it does - assault-style weapons were banned, &amp; deaths by those guns were halved. GOPers would not extend the ban, 17 innocent lives were lost. The blood is on GOP hands.
Shouldn't this gun debate be framed as "Pro-life vs. Pro -violence or even Pro -Death" rather than "Gun Rights Vs. Gun Control"?

Much like drug related laws, gun control legislation is disproportionately enforced in black communities and other marginalised communities. Make no mistake in believing any new law would be treated any different by law enforcement.

Watch the kids protest about gun control to the government. I feel they are talking to the wrong people talk to your classmates cause they are the ones holding that gun and killing people.They can take ever gun off the streets but if people want them they are going to get it.
HOLD SOCIAL WORKERS MORE ACCOUNTABLE
HOLD FBI MORE ACCOUNTABLE
HOLD SHERIFF DEPTS MORE ACCOUBTABLE
and if you must control something about guns- control the ammo that pulverizes organs 
Its not the guns- its the people behind the gun and the people behind that #MarchForOurLives

Gun control actually does work, look at any different country: such as Japan, Australia, Germany and etc. No mass shooting there, than why it's happening in U.S.A ? In our own home #GunContolNow
#MarchForOurLives Everyone keep mentioning Dr.King but his protest was followed by strong economic boycotts. You want gun control stop spending your money. Watch how fast things change. Stop going to the mall,movies,restaurants etc until laws are changed
What the fuck is gun control really about ???
There‚Äôs no doubt this man is a hero, but there are a few more reasons this didn‚Äôt end in more bloodshed:
1. The shooter was using a pistol, not an AR-15. He could *be* confronted without waiting for SWAT to show. 
2. Maryland has strict gun control laws. He couldn‚Äôt get an AR-15. https://t.co/l9GHu00TQY

I'm just in tears this morning seeing these people out all over the world just asking for sensible gun control.  This is a no brainer people.  Dear @GOP &amp; @DNC U represent us and NOT the @NRA Don't do anything?  Fine, you will no longer be there during UR next election for you.

Why are these people marching for gun control? Do they not realize that restricting our freedom and taking our guns away is the equivalent of making us sheep in a field of wolves? Why would you march for that instead of against it?
