Snow Flakes in action lol, #Soros Paid Gun Control Marchers Prove Their Ignorance After Being Asked 1 Simple Question on Guns https://t.co/TOkjwygHje #WeThePeople #GreatAwakening #QAnon	-0.04451622691292874
So #cablenews is dangerous. My friend who watches @MSNBC sooo believes Democrats will control #Congress &amp; change gun laws after November. I told him Trump veto power and conservative #SCOTUS will stop it. He said that doesnt matter b/c people protesting. Just not how it works!	-0.02447019230769231
So @mcqueenhs is suspending kids for calling their elected leaders to express the need for gun control.  Thats fucked up.	-0.041613001383125854
So I'm writing a mini essay on my opinion on gun control for my government class and Pumped Up Kicks by Foster the People started playing.	-0.051603241491085874
So YouTube is going to begin banning gun related videos. Let’s just ignore years of them saying they can’t control ISIS propaganda videos.	-0.04021901408450704
So a little concerned about wing nuts during March, not taking grandkids.   My son says maybe you shouldn’t be there either.  I said it’s too important to miss!   We have to stand up to NRA, but if I get shot I expect my family to be in front of the press.  We need gun control!	-0.046234685863874324
So a lot of these liberals that are defending gun control are google bots made to support liberal politics	-0.04686381818181819
So all those kids walk out of their classrooms, march, etc for gun laws and to prevent more school shootings. 3 days later? Another school shooting. Rinse and repeat. No way anyone can control this shit.	-0.042871428571428574
So are clear back packs not inviting people to rob us?	-0.02817103594080337
So deaths from gun violence have increased while there has been less gun control. https://t.co/6wTMaxGBwa	-0.045041798941798904

So guns kill people even though it takes an actual human being to pull a trigger. However, the same mentally Ill liberals who are marching for gun control have no problem killing (voluntarily ) babies with heartbeats and brains inside a mothers womb. For some reason that's ok.	-0.051603241491085874
So happy @MileyCyrus is at the gun control rally in Washington D.C. we need celebrities involved to make change happen !	-0.045670511140235896

So inspiring turning on the TV and seeing hundreds of thousands of people participating in nationwide marches for gun control set up by high schoolers #MarchForOurLives	-0.041103065693430633
So less the 3 percent of total American population marched for gun control when they were suppose to march for the safety of our kids. I seen not one person march against bombs!	-0.045430617608409975
So let’s find common ground to protect our kids at school.  #REDFLAG  “It’s hard to persuade any man or woman to surrender an unalienable right — especially when exercising that right helps preserve the most vital right of all, the right to live.” https://t.co/3kGM774tSi	-0.009491666666666667
So many failures... but the DEMs leap right to gun control...	-0.04341079622132252
So many people are jumping on the gun control bandwagon. That’s good but no good will come out of a gun grab. It will lead to war and many people will die. You must choose a side.	-0.005200523560209427
So proud of the people marching today!  Gun control has been a long battle but, for the first time, it feels like there is hope! #MarchForOurLives	-0.040831349782293164
So ready to march alongside people who care about other people. I hope and pray this shows our government that we need a better gun control regulation #MarchForOurLives #enoughisenough https://t.co/9H2yAR2QeK	-0.01752483660130719
So sad &amp; misunderstood that these kids think the NRA is responsible, when in fact Dark Web/Media use kids to avenge gun control. If NRA goes away legal gun owners are at serious risk of having their guns confiscated. Meaning no freedom of rights, socialism, marxism. Syria! https://t.co/rnLPQCdzcb	-0.04205880551301682
So sad and gut-wrenching and beautiful and inspiring all at the same time. The right to bear arms and responsible gun control are not mutually exclusive. We can have both. Our children - and my daughters - deserve it. #MarchForOurLives https://t.co/Ljtf4latwd	-0.04520301837270338
So sad this doesn’t get as popular as the mass shooting after math gun control rants 😒 https://t.co/fnLckuhx3W	-0.045670511140235896
So the kids are marching cause they want all of America to be Chicago ? Gun free zone with a very high rate of gun violence ? Gun control works ? #MarchForOurLives	-0.04074853372434017
So the only way the NRA can keep guys interested is using "sexy" pictures of Tomi Laren or Dana Loesch posing with guns? Gun control is gonna be easier than we thought!	-0.045041798941798904
So they should give up gun control and just prepare to die?	-0.02634870848708487

Society is so unbalanced. We put more emphasis on treatment than prevention when there should be an emphasis on both.
