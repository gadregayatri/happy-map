#MarchForOurLives @marchfolchi Don't ask for gun control you sheep, it won't happen w/ Trump &amp; NRA. Ask for ammo control, put a $1 tax on every bullet. Put a serial number on every bullet. There is NO REGULATION on ammo... attack ammo regulation, not guns.	-0.041059423076923056

#MarchForOurLives Current gun control proposals are worthless. 10 yrs after someone sells a gun to someone else, there is no paper trail. Ammo has no regulation. AT ALL. Guns are not registered anywhere. Gov only does background checks, they have no idea what gun you're buying	-0.0409228136882129

Yes, I do believe that gun control laws can and should be changed for the better. But that does not account for the fact that criminals will commit crimes, no matter what law is in place. Last time I checked, murder is still a crime	0.06462380952380953
