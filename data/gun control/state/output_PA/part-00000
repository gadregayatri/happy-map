So have to come clean on this #MarchForOurLives day. Of my 2 14 yo daughters- one is pro gun control, one is not. We have open debates on issues &amp; promote them having a voice. I don’t want robots for kids. But, all 4 of us are proud of the kiddos today for using their voice!	-0.043410256410256386
So if we take out gun control from this scenario ( because gun control hasn’t worked yet) what are you other ideas to stop school shooting? Because I haven’t heard on yet from the left.	-0.045116588235294096
