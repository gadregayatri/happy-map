While International Women's Day is over this year, the path to HIV prevention is continuous! https://t.co/i2hXQHjDOY
So not doing well emotionally. Dysphoria from International Women’s Day has hung on like an unwanted houseguest. All at once, I feel more non-binary than ever, but also frustrated at the constant assumption by cis people that non-binary people want to be lumped in with women.
Happy International 
Women's Day!

Instead of just posting “Happy International Women’s Day” can we talk about real issues. Like how women continue to be discriminated and marginalized. Let's acknowledge that we ourselves take part in sustaining patriarchy through our daily lives.
On this International Women's Day, I'd like to thank all of the strong and powerful women of Twitter who are making such a huge difference.

You are all amazing and I'm honored to call many of you friends!

The International Woman's Day marks combating male dominance and inequlity in the workplace. Brave women fight for those who get abused, harrased, beaten, raped even killed by their spouse/other male family members.

On this International Women's Day, the importance of punctuation will be illustrated with the sentence "Woman without her man is nothing." One could either say: "Woman, without her man, is nothing." Or more appropriately: "Woman: without her, man is nothing."
Every year I ask the same question; why is there an international women's day? Why do we need a day?

ಬೆಳೆವ ಪೈರಿನ ಸೊಬಗ

ಹಳಿಯದೆಲೆ ಕೀರುತಿಯ ತಾರಳೆನುತ!

The origins of "International Women's Day"

The Bolsheviks (USSR) came up with this as a way to keep women in their places.  Women were equal as factory workers - but no women EVER rose above that into a position of leadership in the USSR. Like Earth Day, this is a Soviet ploy. https://t.co/tE56Bm1d36

ಸುಳಿದಾಡುತಿಹ ಮಗಳು
ಬೆಳಗುಕಣ್ಗಳ ಹುಡುಗಿ
ಹೊಳೆವ ಮಿಂಚಿನ ನೋಟ ಅವಳದಿರಲು
ಬೆಳೆವ ಪೈರಿನ ಸೊಬಗ
ಮೊಳಕೆಯಲ್ಲಿಯೆ ನೋಡು
ಹಳಿಯದೆಲೆ ಕೀರುತಿಯ ತಾರಳೆನುತ!

"Holy shit. You guys get _two days off_ for International Women's Day? My country doesn't give a shit about women."
"Yeah, Putin loves it, he has an election coming up later this month."
"I wonder who's going to win?"
